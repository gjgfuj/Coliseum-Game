downwell's dual purpose design:
* ensure every element of the game has more than one purpose.

Turn based RPG. player, and enemies have AP, which is a constant stat. this AP can be used to heal the player, deal damage, do skills, etc. if the player wishes, they can take more damage to receive more AP the next turn.
another creature will join the battle after a certain number of turns, and they are added to the end of a list of enemies. This list has a max size of 10.
 Turns are: each character's pre action happens in turn, then their main action, then their post action happens in turn.

it is possible to mind control enemies. costs a lot of AP, and is still a random roll, forcing to take risks. This means that you can control their actions.

Defeating enemies provide you with increased AP and HP. It is also possible to learn new actions off them.
UI consists of each characters' AP, HP, and skills listed down, with the players from the left. the player's skills are clickable and allow you to choose a target, then each character's action plays out from left to right. and there is a quarter-second interval between each pass of the actions. all characters must decide on which skill to use before the action plays out.
